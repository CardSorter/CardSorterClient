# CardSorter
This is part of the thesis developed by George Melissourgos in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

## Abstract
The structural design of shared information environments is known as Information Architecture.
It’s design is a rather challenging task. Card Sorting constitutes a valuable tool towards this
end. However, there is a lack of free software tools for designing and analysing the collected
data and especially conducting Card Sorting from distance. For this reason, a web-based tool
for conducting such studies was designed and developed in this thesis. This system offers
functionality for creating such studies and collecting data and analysing them in real time. The
software is targeted on fully supporting the researcher’s or practitioner’s needs for conducting
card sorting studies, whilst being available free of charge and open source.
